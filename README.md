# NBA Elo Ratings
This repository contains code for generating NBA Elo ratings. If using `Restart and Run All` in Jupyter Notebook, the program will collect data based on the `years` variable. The notebook currently contains Python code for a few graphs: a comparison of all NBA Elos, a bar graph for each conference, a comparison between Elo and [Basketball Reference's](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) SRS score, how this year's Elo scores correspond to win percentage, and a bar chart showing the number of days a team has been rated top five, and line charts showing how each team's Elo has progressed over the course of the season.
